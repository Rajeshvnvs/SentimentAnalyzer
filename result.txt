Two
or
three
years
ago
only
a
subset
of
people
were
talking
or
thinking
about
Generative
AI.
Most
of
us
were
unaware
it
existed
and
those
who
were
didnâ€™t
realize
the
impact
it
would
have
almost
overnight.
It
was
the
introduction
of
platforms
like
ChatGPT
(launched
in
November
2022)
that
put
the
capabilities
of
Generative
AI
into
the
spotlight
